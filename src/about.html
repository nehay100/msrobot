            <p><b>How do we improve the cooking process within a college lifestyle so that students can explore and experience nutritious foods in the coming years?</b></p>
            <p>The purpose of our project is to assist college students in making delicious, healthy homemade food with limited budget. Since most college students are not equipped with the 
                creative food ideas, our team decided to create an informative website that could help students in making quality, special-kind food. Increasing the availability and accessibility
                of this information is the focus of this project. Based off our user research, we found that most of our audiences find receipes through the web.
